The Pipboy app is a site built on bootstrap, html, css, javascript and jQuery. I wrote this to showcase the knowledge that I learned through the front end web development udemy course in just a couple short months.

Looking through this you should see I am very comfortable with the above. Funny story with bootstrap is in the course he focused on the version of bootstrap from about a year and a half ago. I chose to go with the latest and learned I needed to read a lot of documentation. Which was a great experience and test of knowledge.

This was built based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XLgPKbK5M and the mark 4 in Fallout.

This site is meant to be ran on a crt monitor so you should set your resolution in your browser to 1024X768. I have some approaches I can add to make this more flexible and responsive for mobile but focused on the original scope of modeling off of the mark 4 for mvp. It should run fairly well however on a any size desktop. Just won't look as pretty.

The html files highlights my undersatdning of markdown.

The pipboy.app.css highlights my understanding of styling. I learned that devtools are very much my friend in figuring out the perfect placement.

The pipboy.app.js shows my understanding of jQuery where I built some functionality where you hover over items to show more details and you can click to maintain that item. I also outside of jQuery wrote a couple functions to update the date clock tabs to the exact of each showing my knowledge of vanilla javascript.

The map page also shows a good use of calling an api using googlemaps and it focuses in on Chicago. I ran out of calls on my free account so that is the error you get.

To get the site going drag index.html into your browser or go to this link where I have hosted it here: https://gwalrod.github.io/Pipboy/

I look forward to learning more and to your feedback. I know I have a long way to go and am excited for the journey ahead!
